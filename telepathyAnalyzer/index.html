            <h1>The Totally Fair Telepathy Analyzer</h1>
            <p>
                A -duh- totally fair telepathy analyzer; official test pending.<br />
                How is it totally fair? Because the number is cached, so if you are a psychic you can "feel" it.<br />
                Further, the statistics are shown just for you, so even expert mathematicians will be confused!<br />
                Simply click the right button. The percentage you get right is shown in a progress bar, and the percentages of the two buttons are shown as well. Plus some other useless numbers.<br />
                Note that the number is a Boolean. I don't know how it is stored in memory; probably a 1 or a 0 byte. True is red, False is green.<br />
                "Testing" people will probably test strong for Red and weak for Green, but you should always experiment with it.<br />
                Guess psychics like myself will do better if they already have a bit of code experience or experience with the system, so you should probably start by strong-testing.<br />
                Note that this is a statistically significant test as normal distribution rate at 100,000 passes is 49.9569999 and accuracy is 50.04, this assumes that you are right 50% of the time and wrong 50% of the time.<br />
                Yes, this is about the <b>most kooky thing you can do</b>, but what would the world be without weirdos who are convinced of their own mythic powers by fourty lines of Javascript.<br />
                <h2>Play by clicking the red if the answer is red, and clicking green if the answer is green. I don't care how you find out. This is a kooky game.
