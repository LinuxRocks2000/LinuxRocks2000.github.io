    	<h1>Words of Truth</h1>
    	<p>
    		My belief system is simple. Rather than put my faith in a pantheon of deities, a flock of angles, and a pit of devils, I prefer to take a much more traditional Buddhist approach. I believe that there is a finite, discoverable, and understandable full truth of reality, and "enlightenment" comes from knowledge of this "ultimate truth". I believe that this truth is something of a TOE (Theory of Everything): it consolidates or thoroughly discards every perspective of every science. In this page, I will write down fundamental truths of consciousness and reality, mostly ignoring the scientific part (until, of course, I get my physics PhD), as I discover them.<br />Don't expect lots of updates. I have my best clarity and insight when I'm away from the noise of all my fellow human beings, but I can't use my computer out there to write.
