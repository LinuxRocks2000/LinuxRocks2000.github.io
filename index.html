            <p>
                I opened this site in 2019 as a webcomic project when I first read XKCD and thought it would be cool to run my own. It wasn't very good. A few people read it, but the vast majority were probably just offended by my
                immature political references and poor social-issues jokes. I have moved on. LinuxRocks2000 is officially retired after five years of scanty updates.
